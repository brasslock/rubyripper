Through multiple times ripping the same track and correcting any differences rubyripper tries to deliver a secure rip.

I have decided to stop participating in this project. This leaves no active contributors at this time. Main reason is lack of motivation. I just don't see the need to rip cd's anymore. Streaming services like Spotify and Google Music seem to be so much less time consuming and much more convenient.

I'd like to thank everyone who has participated all this years. There are several alternatives to Rubyripper. Even in the Linux world nowadays. I advise people to use those instead.

Feel free to join the [Rubyripper community on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/103961841006414793555). Might be nice for anyone who was missing a forum or a general place to discuss things :).

  * Moved the git hosting back to Google code again.
  * Merged the refactor branch to master now. Biggest change is the structure for automatic unit/feature tests. Also, the project is splitted so 1 file will match 1 class. These experiments started a bit too enthusiasticly, still have to get the project working again. Currently the command line interface (CLI) works stable and also looks nice I think, but ripping itself doesn't work yet.
